<Abstract>

<Index Key="Circle package">&Circle; package</Index> 
The &GAP;4 package &Circle; extends the &GAP; functionality 
for computations in adjoint groups of associative rings.
It provides functionality to construct circle objects that
will respect the circle multiplication 
<M> r \cdot s = r + s + rs </M>,
create multiplicative groups, generated by such objects,
and compute groups of elements, invertible with respect to
this operation, for finite radical algebras and finite 
associative rings without one.
